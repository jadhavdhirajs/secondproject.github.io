                <h2>Our Certificate & Online Program For 2021</h2>
                <p>The terms diploma and certificate refer to academic credentials awarded to students who complete vocational (or job-training) programs in different subjects. Both diplomas and certificates are available at community colleges, technical and vocational schools, and select undergraduate colleges and universities. Although some institutions use the terms interchangeably, diploma programs tend to be longer and more comprehensive than certificate programs.

                    Certificates and diplomas are each designed for completion within two years, making them both shorter alternatives to the associate degree. They are a popular educational pathway among high school graduates who wish to receive relevant job training and enter the workforce without completing a full degree program, as well as established professionals seeking higher salaries and more advancement opportunities. The popularity of certificates and diplomas has risen in recent years. According to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), 955,000 undergraduate certificates were conferred during the 2017-18 academic year.</p>
